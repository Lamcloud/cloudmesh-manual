Google Drive
============

Google Drive is a file storing platform where an user can store all
his/her files in the google drive. Here files can be of any form ranging
from documents to audio, video or image files. In free account each user
will be given around 15 GB of free data space to be stored. We can
create folders and subfolders in the Google Drive to store our data.

Each file will be stored in Google cloud with a unique URL and itâ€™s up
to the user to make the file sharable or not. Google Drive is reliable
and if an user has different devices and if he/she wants to access those
files then Google Drive is needed in this case as he can have access to
his file as all his files are stored in the cloud. The user does not
need to install any kind of software in order to view these files.
