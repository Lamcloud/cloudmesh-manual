Cloudmesh Cmsd
==============

Cloudmesh is also distributed via docker. However as the docker command line
interface is complex, we wrapped them into a convenient command that can be
installed with `pip`.

At this time we have not yet released this on pypi as we currently still
develop its features. However you can install it in a conveneient fashion on
your system with (we recommend you use a python venv as not to create
sideffects on your sytsem):

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pip -U
    $ pip install cloudmesh-installer -U
    $ cloudmesh-installer git clone docker
    $ cloudmesh-installer git install docker

Now you can use the command

.. code:: bash

    $ cmsd help

The command `cmsd` is supposed to be an inplace replacement of `cms`.

If you like in your shell to rather use cms, you can also set an alias for
`cms` that points to `cmsd`. The reason we did not do this automatically is
that developers may need to have cmsd and cms on their systems at the smae
time.

Note that cmsd assumes you use `~/cloudmesh/.cloudmesh.yaml`


MORE INFORMATION WILL BE PLACED HERE SHORTLY, such as pointers to the manual
page and api documentation.
