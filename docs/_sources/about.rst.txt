About
=====

`Cloudmesh version 4 <https://cloudmesh-community.github.io/cm/>`__ is
an evolution of our previous tool that has been used by hundreds of
students and cloud practitioners to interact easily with clouds to
create a service meshup to access common cloud services across a number
of cloud providers.

It is under active development. It is managed in github at

-  Documentation: https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/
