Many have contributed to cloudmesh in the past.  However, this version has
received contributions from a subset of them. Previous contributors will be
acknowledged once we integrate them in the author script.

Contributors are sorted by the first letter of their combined first name and
last name and if not available by their github ID.  Please, note that the
authors are identified through git logs in addition to some contributors added
by hand. The git repository from which this document is derived contains more
than the documents included in this document. Thus not everyone in this list
may have directly contributed to this document. However if you find someone
missing that has contributed (they may not have used this particular git)
please let us know. We will add you.  The contributors that we are aware of
include:
 

.. include:: ./authors.md
