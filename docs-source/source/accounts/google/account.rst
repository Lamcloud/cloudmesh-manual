Prerequisits

We assume you have the cloudmesh google provider installed. This can be
done with

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install cloudmesh-google

For developers the best way to install it is to use
``cloudmesh-installer``.

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir cm
   $ cd cm
   $ pip install cloudmesh-installer
   $ cloudmesh-installer get google

eductaional account you may need a verifiaction from your school or an
email that is registered as an educational insititution.

Create a Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, you will need to create a Google project. We recommend that you
simply use the name ``cloudmesh``. You can create such a project at
json
-  `Google Storage - Online Data Storage \| Cloud Storage \| Google
   Cloud <https://console.cloud.google.com/>`__

The three screenshots show the workflow on how to create a project:


Create a Service Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. list-table:: Google account creation steps
   :widths: 10 40 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Step
     - Description
     - Screenshot
   * - 1
     - `Create a Service Account <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey?project=cloudmesh-class&folder&organizationId>`__
     - |google-account-1|
   * - 2
     - `Select a project <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production>`__
     - |google-account-2|
   * - 3
     - `Create Service Account Key <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey>`__
     - |google-account-3|


Next, download the key file `client_secret.json` and
`google-drive-credentials.json` To create and download new private key you will use to authenticate.
Select the JSON format and download the file and save it to ``~/.cloudmesh``

Make sure you keep the .cloudmesh directory  secure. This file will be used to
update the YAML entry in the file

``$ ~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml``

As you may use also other clouds we recommend you rename the file to
``google.json`` when you save it, so it is clear to which cloud the json
file belongs.

If your yaml file doe snot yet have a configuartion for the Google service

.. todo:: which one exactly is unclear
pleas use the command::

   $ cms register google google.json

.. todo:: has this been implemented?

Update Cloudmesh with the Google Storage Account Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo:: Now we have two commands. is the config command also working?

::

   $ cms google config add ~/.cloudmesh/google.json --service=google 

MOVE THE CONTENT FROM HERE INTO CONFIGURATION SECTION â€¦

More details of the configuration can v=be looked up in the `Cloudmesh
Configuration Section <MISSING>`__


.. todo:: THE COMMANDS HAVE TO BE REVISITED

    ::

       $ cms google list # what does thsi do?

    THIS NEEDS TO BE RENAMED TO

    ::

       $ cms google config list  # logical
       $ cms google yaml list storage # somewhat logical

Using the Google Storage Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a Google storage bucket is already created, you can list google storage
bucket using following command::

   $ cms google list

From the displayed list please pick bucket of your choice and add bucket
name to yaml file in the storage section for google provider

``storage > google > default > directory``.

If bucket doesnot exist use folling command to create new bucket:

::

   $ cms google create bucket --name=NAME --service=google

NAME: is new bucket name. Important note: Bucket name needs to be
globally unique, you may choose combinantion of your class ID and bucket
name. ``e.g. f19_516_xxx_bucket_name``

You are all set with account setup.
