* **Google Docs:** Google docs is a broader term for Google sheets,
  Google slides and Google forms.
* **Google Sheets:** Just like Microsoft excel sheet Google sheets has
  almost all of the functionality. Google sheets can be shared with
  other people and can concurrently work on it and can edit it. We can
  change the font size, type as we want. We can use the formulas to
  calculate some mathematical expressions. This can be readily
  transformed to `.csv` or `.xlsx` format.
* **Google Slides:** Just like Microsoft PowerPoint presentation,
  Google has Googleslides. We can do small animations,
  transformations of slides. This can be shared with other people to
  edit this on real time basis.
  We can change the font size, type of these as we want.
* **Google Forms:** Out of all Google docs this is the most powerful
  tool when anyone wants to collect data from other people. One can
  make a Google form and can share it via the link. The one who opens
  this link will see a form to fill. We can add many different types
  of survey questions with multiple choice or Multiple options, or
  text entries or date entries or choose from a list entry. This
  google forms can be used to conduct surveys within a close group
  like teachers, students or employees.

In a broader sense Google docs is just a subset of Google Drive.
