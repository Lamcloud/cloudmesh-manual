# Google Storage Providers

## Google Drive


Google Drive is a file storing platform where an user can store all
his/her files in the google drive. Here files can be of any form ranging
from documents to audio, video or image files. In free account each user
will be given around 15 GB of free data space to be stored. We can
create folders and subfolders in the Google Drive to store our data.

Each file will be stored in Google cloud with a unique URL and it's up
to the user to make the file sharable or not. Google Drive is reliable
and if an user has different devices and if he/she wants to access those
files then Google Drive is needed in this case as he can have access to
his file as all his files are stored in the cloud. The user does not
need to install any kind of software in order to view these files.

## Google Docs

Google docs is especially designed for viewing or editing or sharing the
documents like Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms. No need to install any
software to access or edit these. And google doc can be sharable with
editable option. There is an automatic mechanism to convert Microsoft
documents to Google Docs.

-   **Google Docs:** Google docs is a broader term for Google sheets,
    Google slides and Google forms.
-   **Google Sheets:** Just like Microsoft excel sheet Google sheets has
    almost all of the functionality. Google sheets can be shared with
    other people and can concurrently work on it and can edit it. We can
    change the font size, type as we want. We can use the formulas to
    calculate some mathematical expressions. This can be readily
    transformed to `.csv` or `.xlsx` format.
-   | **Google Slides:** Just like Microsoft PowerPoint presentation,
      Google has Googleslides. We can do small animations,
      transformations of slides. This can be shared with other people to
      edit this on real time basis.
    | We can change the font size, type of these as we want.

-   **Google Forms:** Out of all Google docs this is the most powerful
    tool when anyone wants to collect data from other people. One can
    make a Google form and can share it via the link. The one who opens
    this link will see a form to fill. We can add many different types
    of survey questions with multiple choice or Multiple options, or
    text entries or date entries or choose from a list entry. This
    google forms can be used to conduct surveys within a close group
    like teachers, students or employees.

In a broader sense Google docs is just a subset of Google Drive.

## Getting the google json files

- [ ] TODO: Google account. the documentation on how to get the json files is
  missing


- [ ] TODO: Google account. A program that takes the json files and integrates them
  into [cloudmesh4.yaml]{.title-ref}

- [ ] TODO: Google account. The documentation for getting access to google cloud is
  incomplete, see related entries.


-   `client_secret.json`
-   `google-drive-credentials.json`

If we run the Google Drive `Provider.py` for the **First time** then the
required keys, tokens are taken from the `cloudmesh4.yaml` file and
creates a `client_secret.json` file in the following path
`~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/`

- [ ] TODO: The Authentication.py program was removed, so this can not work.


The `Authentication.py` creates a `.credentials` folder under the
following path `~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/` if it does not exist and creates a
`google-drive-credentials.json` file under the following folder
`~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/.credentials/`

So, for the **first time** browser will be opened up automatically and
asks for the Google Drive(gmail) credentials i.e., login email and
password. If you provide these 2 then the Authentication step is
completed and then it will create the `google-drive-credentials.json`
and place it in `~/.cloudmesh/gdrive/.credentials/` folder.

## Python Google Drive API


### Step-by-step process

Before writing the Python interface for Google Drive, we need to setup
an email account, with that email account we will get a set of google
services and one of them is Google Drive with 15 GB overall storage.

After that we need to go through the Google Drive Quick start guide:

-   <https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python>

There we can see Enable API option as shown in the next picture:

![Enable API](images/gdrive/image1.png)

Once we enable that we will get credentials.json file where all of our
credentials are stored that can be used to communicate with our Google
Drive through Python Interface. After that, we will be redirected to a
page where we need to create our own project as shown in the next
picture:

![Create a project](images/gdrive/image2.png)

As we see next we need to select Google Drive API from here

![Add credentials](images/gdrive/image16.png)

After that, we need to obtain the client\_secret file as shown next:
(The file that is downloaded as `client_id.json` needs to be renamed as
`client_secret.json`)

![Rename the file](images/gdrive/image18.png)

After this we need to click `Done` otherwise it would not set the Google
Drive API.

After this if we run Authentication.py we will be redirected to our
default browser to put our our login id and password and after that it
asks to authenticate our credentials. If we allow that as shown next:

![Grant permissions](images/gdrive/image21.png)

We will get the screen something like given next (as the authentication
pipeline has bees completed).

![Authentication success](images/gdrive/image23.png)

::: {.todo}
Google account. This documentation is a bit unstructured and repetitive.
Yet errors such as references to Authentication.py are conducted which
does not exist.
:::

If the authentication flow is completed then the Authentication.py will
create a `google-drive-credentials.json` file in `.credentials` folder.
This file can be used for future purposes. If we delete this file then
the `Authentication.py` will again ask for login id and password and
again create that file automatically.

So, now with the

-   `client_secret.json`,
-   `google-drive-credentials.json`

we can now use

- [ ] TODO: Google account. This documentation is a bit unstructured and repetitive.
  Yet errors such as references to Authentication.py are conducted which
  does not exist.


-   `Authentication.py` and `Provider.py`

- [ ] TODO: Google account. location of the file is missing

Once all these steps are done correctly, then we can use the Python
program interface to transfer the files between our Python program and
Google Drive.
