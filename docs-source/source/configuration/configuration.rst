Configuration
=============

The Configuration of cloudmesh is controled with a yaml file that is
placed in ``~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh4.yaml``. It is created automatically
from the template located at

-  https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-cloud/blob/master/cloudmesh/etc/cloudmesh4.yaml

You can customize the file while editing it.


Cloudmesh Yaml File Object definitions
--------------------------------------

Getting Values
--------------

We implemented a convenient get method in case you need to look up some values in the configuration file. For example::

    cms config get cloudmesh.profile
    cms config get cloudmesh.profile.firstname

print information out. While the first points to a dict, it prints out all the values form that dict, the last is an
attribute and just prints out the attribute and its value.

Setting values
--------------

In addition if you need to set quickly a value in the configuration file you can do this with::

    cms config get cloudmesh.profile.firstname=Gregor

Will set the firstname in the profiles to Gregor

This command at this time does not work on dicts, so you need to define each attribute.

Editing Values
--------------

In case the values in the yaml file are having a TBD the can also be edited with our built in command that requires you
to specify the dict in which such values occur.

For example, let us assume the value in cloudmesh.profile.firstname is TBD then, the command::

    cms config edit cloudmesh.profile

Can be used to change it.

Advanced Yaml Variables
-----------------------

One of the features of the cloudmesh yaml framework is that it allows you to
use previously defined attributes in the yaml file itself. Thus if an
attribute value contains for example  `"{cloudmesh.attribute}"` or any
environment variable, it will find the value for this dict entry in the yaml
file and replace it
with its value. For example. let us assume the yaml file contains::

    cloudmesh:
      profile:
        name: Gregor
      cloud:
        aws:
          username: "{cloudmesh.profile.name}"
          key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
          dir: $HOME
          current: .

cloudmesh will replace the will result be transformed with::

    cloudmesh:
      profile:
        name: Gregor
      cloud:
        aws:
          username: "Gregor"
          key: /home/gergor/.ssh/id_rsa
          dir: /home/gregor
          current: /home/gregor/github/cm

This feature is naturally very useful for creating templates for users


Profile
-------

The profile defines simple information about you::

  profile:
    firstname: TBD
    lastname: TBD
    email: TBD@sample.edu
    user: TBD
    github: TBD
    publickey: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


Default
-------

The variable default is used to identify information about your experiments and groups that are used throughout your
interaction with cloudmesh.

  default:
    group: cloudmesh
    experiment: base
    cloud: azure
    cluster: clustera

The values can be set with the default command

.. todo:: implement the default command and set values in it. This may already be done. we may need to add the dot
          notation for that command so we have one command that can set the general default, but also the default for
          named services.

          a link to the manual page should come here



General Service Attributes
-------------------

Each cloudmesh service must have an attribute ``cm`` with the following fields. if an attribute contains the value TBD
it needs to be updated. You only have to update the providers you like to use, you can delete the others if you like.

cm
~~

In the ``cm` portion we define elementary information that identifies the service. This includes
The following information

active
    if set to True, this cloud is going to be used in cloudmesh, if it is set to False it is not activated.
    This has the advantage that you do not have to remove
    the service from the yaml file if you do not use it

heading
    This field is currently not used, but in future releases this field will be use in table or GUIs to be printed
    when list functions are used

label
    This field is typically the same as the entry under which the cloud service is filed. In our case it is aws. It is
    a convenient abbreviation that can be used in your programs.

kind
    This field is the most important field that identified what kind of service your cloud is and it will determine
    based on its name how to interact with the service.

    For compute services the following kinds are valid: ``aws``, ``azure``, ``google``, ``openstack``

    For storage services the following kinds are valid: ``aws``, ``azure``, ``google``, ``openstack``, ``box``

host
    This field is used to identify where to find information aboout the service provider

service
    The type of service. valid values are ``compute``, ``storage``.

::

    cm:
        active: False
        heading: AWS
        host: aws.amazon.com
        label: aws
        kind: aws
        version: 1.0
        service: compute

Compute Cloud Providers
-----------------------

The default yaml file includes templates to configure various clouds.
You can change these defaults and provide access to your cloud
credentials to make the management of cloud virtual machines easier.
Templates for AWS, Azure, Google, OpenStack are provided. Specific
templates for Jetstream and Chameleopn cloud are included in the example
`cloudmesh4.yaml <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-cloud/blob/master/cloudmesh/etc/cloudmesh4.yaml>`__.
We list each template next.

We explain in more detail the features of the configuration files for cloud services.

First all cloud services are listed under the key ``cloud``. You can add arbitrary compute cloud services
with a name you like. You can even create multiple names that refer to the same cloud but may have different parameters.
We like to focus on the example for ``aws`` and explain this in a bit more detail.


The cloudmesh entry for a compute service is divided into three portions:
``cm``, ``default``, and ``credentials``. The format of the ``cm`` is explained previously.


Default
~~~~~~~

The next category are defaults that can be preset for each cloud. However defaults are overwritten by the cloudmesh shell
variables. So they are only used once at startup if these defaults are not already defined by cloudmesh shell. Typically
we use them to for example define values for images and sizes or flavors of images

image
    The name of the default image

size
    The size of the default image

credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~

The credentials are dependent on the kind of the cloud and include all information needed for authenticate and use the
cloud service.

As the infromation is sensitive the file in .cloudmesh holding this information must be properly protected.

.. note:: We even have a project that encrypts the cloudmesh.yaml file, but it is not fully integrated yet.
          Future versions of cloudmesh will encrypt the information by default.

OpenStack
~~~~~~~~~

We provide an example on how to use an OpenStack based cloud in
cloudmesh. Please ass the following to your ``cloudmesh4.yaml`` file and
replace the values for ``TBD``. Our example uses `Chameleon
Cloud <https://www.chameleoncloud.org/>`__. This is a cloud for academic
research. Certainly you can configure other clouds based on this
template. We have successfully used also clouds in Canada (Cybera),
Germany (KIT), Indiana University (jetstream). TO get started you can
even install your local cloud with devstack and make adjustements.
Please remember you can have multiple clouds in the ``cloudmesh4.yaml``
file so you could if you have access to them integrate all of them.
You will need access to a project and add your project nump=ber to. the credentials.
Example for chameleon cloud::

   cloudmesh:
     ...
     cloud:
       ...
       chameleon:
         cm:
           active: True    
           heading: Chameleon
           host: chameleoncloud.org

Virtual Box
~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtualbox has at this time limited functionality, but creation, ssh,
and deletion of the virtual box is possible.

You can also integrate virtualbox as part of cloudmesh while providing
the following description::

   cloudmesh:

Storage Providers
-----------------

General description for all storage providers, comment on the
``default:`` and what that does

AWS S3
~~~~~~

It is beyond the scope of this manual to discuss how to get an account
on Google. However we do provide a convenient documentation at
:doc:`../accounts/aws`.


In the ``cloudmesh4.yaml`` file, the ‘aws’ section under ‘storage’
describes an example configuration or a AWS S3 storage provider. In the
credentials section under aws, specify the access key id and secret
access key which will be available in the AWS console under AWS IAM
``service`` -> ``Users`` -> ``Security Credentials``. Container is the
default Bucket which will be used to store the files in AWS S3. Region
is the geographic area like ``us-east-1`` which contains the bucket.
Region is required to get a connection handle on the S3 Client or
resource for that geographic area. Here is a sample::

   cloudmesh:
     ...
     storage:
       aws:
         cm:
           heading: aws
           host: amazon.aws.com
           label: aws
           kind: awsS3
           version: TBD
           service: storage
         default:
           directory: /
         credentials:
           access_key_id: *********
           secret_access_key: *******
           container: name of bucket that you want user to be contained in.
           region: Specfiy the default region eg us-east-1

.. todo:: Make credentials more uniform between compute and data


.. _azure-1:

Azure
~~~~~

It is beyond the scope of this manual to discuss how to get an account
on Microsoft Azure. However we do provide a convenient documentation at
:doc:`../accounts/azure`.

The ``cloudmesh4.yaml`` file needs to be set up as follows for the
‘azureblob’ section under ‘storage’::

   cloudmesh:
     ...
     storage:
       azureblob:
         cm:
           heading: Azure
           host: azure.com
           label: Azure
           kind: azureblob
           version: TBD
           service: storage
         default:
           directory: /
         credentials:
           account_name: '*****************'
           account_key: '********************************************************************'
           container: 'azuretest'

Configuration settings for credentials in the yaml file can be obtained
from Azure portal.

TODO: More information via a pointer to a documentation you create needs
to be added here

In the yaml file the following values have to be changed

-  ``account_name`` - This is the name of the Azure blob storage
   account.
-  ``account_key`` - This can be found under ‘Access Keys’ after
   navigating to the storage account on the Azure portal.
-  ``container`` - This can be set to a default container created under
   the Azure blob storage account.

Google drive
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to bugs in the requirements of the google driver code, we have not
yet included it in the Provider code. This needs to be fixed before we
can do this.

It is beyond the scope of this manual to discuss how to get an account
on Google. However we do provide a convenient documentation at
:doc:`../accounts/google`.

The ``cloudmesh4.yaml`` file needs to be set up as follows for the
‘gdrive’ section under ‘storage’::

   cloudmesh:
     ...
     storge:
       gdrive: 
         cm: 
           heading: GDrive
           host: gdrive.google.com

           token_uri: "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
         default: 
           directory: TBD

Box
~~~

It is beyond the scope of this manual to discuss how to get an account
on Google. However we do provide a convenient documentation at
:doc:`../accounts/box`.


In the ``cloudmesh4.yaml`` file, find the ‘box’ section under ‘storage’.
Under credentials, set ``config_path`` to the path of the configuration
file you created as described in the Box chapter::

   cloudmesh:
     ...
     box:
       cm:
         heading: Box
         host: box.com
         label: Box

Log File
--------

.. note::  Previos versions of cloudmesh had a sophisticated logging feature.
           This version has this feature not yet made available. Implement it
           and make avialable. At this time it is not our highest priority.

Log files are stored by default in ``~/.cloudmesh/log`` The directory
can be specified in the yaml file.


Mongo
-----

MongoDB
-------

The cache of cloudmesh is managed in a mongo db database with various
collections. However the user does not have to manage thes collections
as this is done for the user through cloudmesh. Before you can use it it
mongo does need to be installed.

If you have not installed mongo, you may try

.. code:: bash

   cms admin mongo install

However, to install it with cms, you must also make sure the following values are
installed in the cloudmesh yaml file::

    ...
    MONGO_PASSWORD: TBD
    ...
    MONGO_AUTOINSTALL: True

The value for the password must not be ``TBD``.

Next you create the database template with authentication with

.. code:: bash

   cms admin mongo create

Now you are ready to use it in cloudmesh. The mongo db can be started
and stoped with the command

.. code:: bash

   $cms admin mongo start
   $cms admin mongo stop

The configuration detals are included in the yaml file and looks like::

   cloudmesh:
     ...
        mongo:
          MONGO_AUTOINSTALL: False
          MONGO_BREWINSTALL: False
          LOCAL: ~/local
          MONGO_HOME: ~/local/mongo
