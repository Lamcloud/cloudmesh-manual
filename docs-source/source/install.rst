Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you install make sure that you have at minimum python 3.7.3
installed. Likely the code will work with earlier versions, but we do
the development in python 3.7.3.

Use a venv
----------

We highly recommend that you use a python virtualenv such as ``venv`` to
make sure you are not interfering with your system python. This is
simple. For our purposes we assume that you use the directory ~/ENV3.
Follow these steps first:

.. code:: bash

   python3.7 -m venv  ~/ENV3
   source  ~/ENV3/bin/activate

You can add at the end of your .bashrc or .bash_profile file the line

.. code:: bash

    source ~/ENV3/bin/activate

so the environment is always loaded. Now you are ready to install
cloudmesh.

Installation with Pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The instalation can be done with pip.

.. code:: bash

   pip install cloudmesh-cms
   pip install cloudmesh-sys
   pip install cloudmesh-cloud
   pip install cloudmesh-storage

Additional packages include but are not yet released:

.. code:: bash

   pip install cloudmesh-flow
   pip install cloudmesh-emr
   pip install cloudmesh-batch
   pip install cloudmesh-openapi

.. code:: bash

   cms help

works. Make susre to stay up to date while issuing the pull command on
your bundle

.. code:: bash

   cloudmesh-installer git pull bundle
   cloudmesh-installer install storage -e

Installation of mongod
----------------------

First, you will need to install a ``cloudmesh4.yaml`` file, if you have
not done this before. The easieast way to do so is with the command

.. code:: bash

   cms help

Now you will need to edit the file

``~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh4.yaml``

and change the password of the mongo entry to something you like,
e.g.Â change the TBD to a real strong password

::

   MONGO_PASSWORD: TBD

In case you do not have mongod installed, you can do so for macOS and
Ubuntu 18.xx by setting the following variable:

::

   MONGO_AUTOINSTALL: True

Now you can run the ``admin mongo install`` command. It will not only
install mongo, but also add the path to your ``.bash_*`` file. In case
of windows platform, you will have to set the PATH variable manually. To
install it simply say.

.. code:: bash

   cms admin mongo install

To create a password protection you than run the command

.. code:: bash

    cms admin mongo create

In case of Windows platform, after
executing above command, open a new cms session and execute below
commands.

.. code:: bash

   cms admin mongo start

Once the mongo db is created it can be started and stoped with

.. code:: bash

   cms admin mongo start
   cms admin mongo stop

For cloudmesh to work properly, please start mongo.

Anaconda and Conda
------------------

We also have the base packages available as conda packages on conda hub
in the chanel ``laszewski``. This includes

-  cloudmesh-common
-  cloudmesh-cmd5
-  cloudmesh-sys

Note that the packages will always be a little bit behind the packages
on pypi and especially the source distribution. If you are interested in
helping out with the conda packages, let us know.

Source Installation for Developers
----------------------------------

First makes sure you have a python virtual env as described in the pip
section. Instead of using the pip install method, please use the
following.

As a developer you want o use our source instalation. For this reasone
we wrote a cloudmesh-installer script that conveniently downloads the
needed repositories. More documentation about it can be found at

-  https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-installer

You install it with

.. code:: bash

   pip install cloudmesh-installer

It is best to create an empty directory and decide which bundles to
install

.. code:: bash

   mkdir cm
   cd cm
   cloudmesh-installer bundels

Decide which bundels you like to install (let us assume you use storage)
and simply say

.. code:: bash

   cloudmesh-installer git clone storage
   cloudmesh-installer install storage -e

It will take a while to install On newer machines 1 minte, on older
significant longer. You can than test if
