# Cloudmesh Graphical User Interface

## Goals

In this project you will be developing a graphical user interface for
cloudmesh based on Electron. You will be focusing on first displaying the
information available in the cloudmesh database. This includes, information
from clouds about

* images
* flavors
* virtual machines
* keys
* security groups

You will also develop a convenient registration form that dynamically
creates a form for including credentials from the various clouds based
on the cloudmesh configuration file. For 

* virtual machines
* keys
* security groups

uploading new information including starting new vms is required. The clouds
we consider are

* openstack
* AWS
* Azure
* Google

## Requirements

This project is easy for those with javascript experience. We will not
consider other GUI frameworks. If you however find a better one, please
discuss with us first.

## Difficulty

*easy - moderate:* This is an easy project as in theory you will only need
minimal access to the cloud while making sure you obtain information for
each of the data types,  which can either be obtained from cloudmesh or can
be found in the code base where examples are posted.  

## Deliverables

* Working code
* Video documenting the use of the GUI

  * showcasing image, flavor, and vm interactions
  * showcasing registration for clouds 
* checkins into github by all team members. If only one team member checks in
  all other team members will not get credit.
